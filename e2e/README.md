# end-to-end testing

This package holds end-to-end tests to verify CCM functionality for a set of supported Kubernetes versions.

It may be run either locally or on the CI.

## usage

The easiest way to run the end-to-end test is to execute `e2e.sh`. It requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: the DigitalOcean access token
- `KOPS_REGION`: the DigitalOcean region (e.g., _SFO2_)
- `S3_ENDPOINT`: the Spaces endpoint; should consist of the `KOPS_REGION` followed by the official Spaces API host (e.g., _sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com_)
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: the Spaces access key ID
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the Spaces secret access key ID
- `KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME`: The cluster name; needs to be managed by the DigitalOcean nameserver (e.g., _k8stest.mydomain.com_)

The following environment parameters are optional:

- `SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE`: path to the public SSH key matching the private key configured on DigitalOcean (default: `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)

`e2e.sh` invokes the end-to-end tests which in turn invoke `setup_cluster.sh` and `destroy_cluster.sh` to create clusters before the test executes and tears them down again on completion of a test, respectively. The scripts may also be called manually, which then needs the `KOPS_STATE_STORE` environment variable to be set explicitly and point to the Spaces bucket name as in `do://myuniquespace`.

`e2e.sh` reads the `E2E_RUN_FILTER` environment variable and passes any non-empty content to `go test`'s `-run` flag to filter for specific tests.
